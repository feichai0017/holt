//! `BufferManager` — LRU-bounded blob cache.
//!
//! Sits between a [`Tree`](crate::Tree) and its underlying
//! [`Backend`]. Itself implements `Backend`, so it's a transparent
//! drop-in: callers see the same `read_blob` / `write_blob` /
//! `flush` API, but reads of recently-touched blobs hit the cache
//! and skip the inner backend's I/O.
//!
//! ## Write protocol — staged through `dirty` + `pending_deletes`
//!
//! The walker mutates blobs via [`CachedBlob::write`] guards;
//! those edits stay in cache until a flush pushes them through.
//! Two flush paths exist:
//!
//! - **Synchronous checkpoint** — [`crate::Tree::checkpoint`]
//!   drains the dirty map, clones cached bytes, then calls
//!   [`BufferManager::write_through_batch`] with the snapshotted seqs.
//! - **Background checkpointer** — drives the same protocol from
//!   its planner/I/O threads; see [`BufferManager::snapshot_dirty`]
//!   / [`BufferManager::restore_dirty`].
//!
//! The `write_blob` trait method is still write-through (cache +
//! backend in one call). Internal call sites that produce a new
//! blob (spillover) or unlink one (erase's `SubtreeGone` /
//! merge) go through [`BufferManager::install_new_blob`] /
//! [`BufferManager::mark_for_delete`] instead, so the backend
//! write or manifest mutation is deferred until the next flush —
//! invariant **W2D** below.
//!
//! ## Dirty tracking + deferred deletes
//!
//! Every walker write tags its target blob via
//! [`BufferManager::mark_dirty`] with the WAL seq that authored
//! the change. The internal dirty state keeps the **lowest**
//! unflushed seq per blob — that value is the WAL trim watermark
//! for that blob (records below it are already in backend, so the
//! WAL doesn't need them). A checkpoint round moves drained
//! entries into an in-flight `flushing` set until their cached
//! bytes have reached the backend; eviction treats both maps as
//! protected.
//!
//! Erase ops that empty a child blob queue a deferred deletion
//! via [`BufferManager::mark_for_delete`] — the `backend.delete_blob`
//! syscall runs only after the corresponding WAL record is on
//! disk.
//!
//! Invariants:
//!
//! - **I1**: a `(guid, _)` entry exists in `dirty` iff the cached
//!   image of `guid` is newer than the backend image.
//! - **I2**: WAL `trim_id <= min(dirty.values()) - 1` (or
//!   `next_seq - 1` if `dirty` is empty).
//! - **I3**: [`BufferManager::snapshot_dirty`] drains the map
//!   atomically, so `mark_dirty` calls that race with a checkpoint
//!   round land in the new (empty) map and are tracked for the
//!   next round. [`BufferManager::snapshot_pending_deletes`] has
//!   the same drain semantics.
//! - **W2D**: any byte written to `backend.data_file` or any
//!   manifest mutation persisted to disk must have its
//!   corresponding WAL record durably on disk first.
//!
//! ## Per-blob locking — 3-mode `HybridLatch`
//!
//! Each cached blob lives behind a `HybridLatch` (LeanStore-style
//! 3-mode latch) wrapping an `UnsafeCell<AlignedBlobBuf>`:
//!
//! - **Optimistic** — wait-free. Snapshot the latch version, read
//!   the buffer without a real lock, then `validate()` afterwards.
//!   If a writer lapped the snapshot, the read is discarded and
//!   the caller restarts. Used by `Tree::get`'s walker.
//! - **Shared** — N readers run concurrently, mutually exclusive
//!   with writers. Checkpoint byte snapshots take this mode long
//!   enough to clone the cached image.
//! - **Exclusive** — single writer, mutually exclusive with all
//!   readers. Used by every walker mutation hop (`insert_multi`
//!   / `erase_multi` / spillover).
//!
//! ## Pin-and-operate
//!
//! Callers that want to operate on a blob without an intervening
//! 512 KB memcpy use [`BufferManager::pin`] — it returns an
//! `Arc<CachedBlob>` holding the buffer alive in cache. The
//! `Arc`'s strong count keeps eviction at bay. From there:
//!
//! - [`CachedBlob::read_optimistic`] → wait-free [`OptimisticGuard`]
//!   with `as_slice()` + `validate()`. Wrap with
//!   `BlobFrameRef::wrap(guard.as_slice())` for zero-copy traversal.
//! - [`CachedBlob::read`] → [`BlobReadGuard`] (shared). Same
//!   `BlobFrameRef::wrap` shape, but blocks behind any active writer.
//! - [`CachedBlob::write`] → [`BlobWriteGuard`] (exclusive). Use
//!   `guard.frame()` for in-place mutation. The owning tree later
//!   publishes dirty state and checkpoint writes it through via
//!   [`BufferManager::write_through_batch`].
//!
//! ## Eviction
//!
//! Two paths drop cold cache entries:
//!
//! - **Inline overflow** ([`Self::try_evict_lru`]) — fires inside
//!   [`Self::insert_into_cache`] when the new entry pushes the
//!   cache past `capacity`. Picks the entry with the oldest
//!   `last_touched` tick whose `Arc::strong_count == 1` (no
//!   outside pin). O(n) walk over the cache, called only on the
//!   overflow path; the background eviction thread handles
//!   steady-state reclaim cheaply.
//! - **Background sweep** ([`crate::checkpoint`] eviction
//!   thread) — periodic walk based on the same `last_touched`
//!   tick + `eviction_idle_ticks` threshold. Snapshots the cache
//!   under shard locks, then drops the snapshot's Arc clones
//!   before calling `try_evict_cold` so the BM's `strong_count`
//!   check sees only the shard's own reference.
//!
//! The cache may temporarily exceed `capacity` while every entry
//! is pinned; it shrinks back as readers drop their handles or
//! the background sweep catches up.
//!
//! ## Concurrent sharding
//!
//! The cache is a [`DashMap`] (sharded concurrent `HashMap`) so
//! `pin` / `get_cached` calls on different blobs hit different
//! shards — no single global mutex on the hot read path. The
//! sharded cache + tick-based eviction together replace what
//! would otherwise be a per-blob bottleneck on multi-threaded
//! workloads.
