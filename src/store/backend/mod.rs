//! Storage backend layer.
//!
//! Only two backends exist in holt and only two ever will:
//!
//! | Backend | Purpose |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`MemoryBackend`]     | Tests, ephemeral trees, in-memory KV |
//! | [`PersistentBackend`] | File-backed durable storage; `O_DIRECT` on Linux, `F_NOCACHE` on macOS |
//!
//! Both run on every supported platform — holt is **Unix-only**
//! (Linux + macOS); the crate refuses to compile on Windows.
//!
//! The trait surface ([`Backend`]) is blob-granular: read / write a
//! full `PAGE_SIZE` ([`crate::layout::PAGE_SIZE`]) frame, list, delete,
//! flush. Anything coarser (multi-blob transactions, page caching,
//! eviction) lives above this layer in the buffer manager + WAL.
//!
//! All I/O flows through [`AlignedBlobBuf`] — a 4 KB-aligned heap
//! buffer that is safe to hand directly to `O_DIRECT` and that
//! `io_uring` can register for zero-syscall submission.

/// # Contract
/// - `read_blob` / `write_blob` always operate on a full
///   `PAGE_SIZE`-byte frame. Partial I/O is not supported.
/// - `write_blob` is **atomic at the blob level**: either the entire
///   new image is visible to subsequent reads, or the old image is.
///   No torn writes (`PersistentBackend` achieves this via O_DIRECT
///   page-aligned writes on NVMe — physically atomic for ≤ 4 KB,
///   logically atomic for 512 KB via journal coordination).
/// - `flush` blocks until **every** write that returned before the
///   call is durable on the underlying medium.
