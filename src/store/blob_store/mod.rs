//! Blob-store layer.
//!
//! This layer is deliberately blob-granular: the ART and buffer
//! manager hand it complete 512 KB frames identified by `BlobGuid`.
//!
//! | BlobStore | Purpose |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`MemoryBlobStore`]     | Tests, ephemeral trees, in-memory KV |
//! | [`FileBlobStore`] | File-backed durable storage; `O_DIRECT` on Linux, `F_NOCACHE` on macOS |
//!
//! Both stores run on every supported platform — holt is **Unix-only**
//! (Linux + macOS); the crate refuses to compile on Windows.
//!
//! The trait surface ([`BlobStore`]) is blob-granular: read / write a
//! full `PAGE_SIZE` ([`crate::layout::PAGE_SIZE`]) frame, list, delete,
//! flush. Anything coarser (multi-blob atomicity, page caching,
//! eviction) lives above this layer in the buffer manager + WAL.
//!
//! All I/O flows through [`AlignedBlobBuf`] — a 4 KB-aligned
//! frame that is safe to hand directly to `O_DIRECT`. Linux
//! `io_uring` file stores can lease these frames from a registered
//! fixed-buffer pool, but that allocator stays below the store
//! boundary.
