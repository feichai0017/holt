//! `FileBlobStore` — file-backed durable blob store.
//!
//! Available on every Unix platform. The Linux build opens the
//! packed data file with `O_DIRECT` so the kernel does not cache
//! blob frames (the buffer manager *is* the cache). The rebuildable
//! read index uses buffered positional I/O because it serves small
//! index records rather than authoritative blob frames.
//!
//! Layout on disk:
//!
//! ```text
//!   <data_dir>/
//!     blobs.dat      — single packed file, blob N lives at byte
//!                      offset N * PAGE_SIZE
//!     manifest.bin   — small file mapping BlobGuid → slot number
//!                      plus `next_slot`;
//!                      rewritten only when the manifest delta log
//!                      is compacted
//!     manifest.log   — append-only set/delete deltas replayed on
//!                      open; free slots are rebuilt from holes
//!     read.idx       — optional packed read indexes, one slot
//!                      per blob slot; rebuildable and never part of
//!                      recovery truth
//!     value.seg      — optional packed read value payloads, one
//!                      slot per blob slot; referenced only by
//!                      `read.idx` entries and rebuildable
//!     store.lock     — zero-byte advisory lock file; readers hold a
//!                      shared flock and writers hold an exclusive
//!                      flock for the lifetime of an open instance
//! ```
//!
//! Design rationale:
//!
//! - **Single packed file** instead of one-file-per-blob: a buffer
//!   manager pinning thousands of blobs would otherwise need
//!   thousands of file descriptors. One fd + slot offsets keeps the
//!   kernel page tables and fs metadata trivial.
//! - **O_DIRECT / F_NOCACHE** bypasses the page cache for
//!   `blobs.dat`: ours *is* the cache. The buffer manager owns dirty
//!   pages and flushes through the store. The packed data file is
//!   preallocated in coarse chunks (`posix_fallocate` on Linux,
//!   `F_PREALLOCATE` on macOS) so checkpoint bursts do not
//!   repeatedly pay file-growth allocation latency.
//! - **4 KB-aligned I/O** (every offset is a multiple of `PAGE_SIZE`
//!   = 512 KB, every buffer is [`AlignedBlobBuf`] = 4 KB aligned) so
//!   `O_DIRECT` accepts every submission without `EINVAL`.
//! - **Manifest** holds the GUID → slot mapping. Checkpoint rounds
//!   append small set/delete deltas to `manifest.log` and fsync it
//!   instead of rewriting the whole map. When the log grows well
//!   past the snapshot size it compacts into `manifest.bin` via
//!   tmp+rename and truncates the log. Blob replacement uses shadow
//!   paging: write and sync a fresh slot, publish its mapping, then
//!   make the old slot reusable only after the manifest delta is durable.
//! - **Read accelerators** are fixed-slot and rebuildable. `read.idx`
//!   and `value.seg` share the same manifest slot as `blobs.dat`.
//!   A shadow slot's stale accelerator header is cleared before its
//!   mapping is published; checkpoint publication writes value bytes
//!   first and the index header last. Slot reuse is the
//!   normal reclamation mechanism, avoiding an append-only value-segment
//!   GC. Explicit `vacuum` compacts live high-water slots into lower
//!   reusable holes, carries their advisory read accelerators with the
//!   blob slot, truncates the packed-file tail, and, on Linux, punches
//!   any remaining reusable middle-slot holes so sparse files can return
//!   blocks to the filesystem.
//!
//! ## I/O store
//!
//! Two code paths share the same `FileBlobStore` struct:
//!
//! - **`pread`/`pwritev`** (default): every Unix target, every build
//!   configuration. Reads use `FileExt::read_exact_at`; checkpoint
//!   write batches coalesce slot-contiguous blobs with `pwritev`.
//! - **`io_uring`** (`cfg(target_os = "linux")` + `feature =
//!   "io-uring"`): submits one SQE per read/write to a dedicated
//!   ring owned by the store. Eliminates the per-syscall entry/
//!   exit cost on Linux.
//!
//! Both paths share the same on-disk layout and the same
//! `BlobStore::flush` semantics (`sync_data` + manifest persist).
//! Switching between them is an internal performance toggle; no
//! caller-visible behaviour changes.
