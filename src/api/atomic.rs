//! `AtomicBatch` — buffer multiple ops for a single-record WAL commit.
//!
//! Companion to [`super::tree::Tree::atomic`]. The batch is a
//! mutation/guard accumulator: each `put` / `delete` / `rename`
//! call copies its inputs into the pending list, and each `assert_*`
//! call buffers a logical precondition. Nothing touches the tree
//! until the closure passed to `Tree::atomic` returns; then
//! `Tree::apply_batch` drains the pending list under the
//! mutation gate and emits one Batch WAL record.
//!
//! Atomicity contract is documented on `Tree::atomic` — short
//! version: logical preconditions are checked before mutation,
//! concurrent writers and range/view readers cannot observe
//! intermediate batch state, and replay sees all-or-nothing.
