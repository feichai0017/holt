//! Public `Tree` type — the main user-facing API.
//!
//! ## Internal key encoding
//!
//! The walker treats every user-supplied point key as if it had a
//! trailing `\0` byte. This is a standard ART trick to resolve the
//! "strict prefix" case where one key (e.g. `"abc"`) is a prefix
//! of another (e.g. `"abcdef"`): the terminator guarantees the two
//! keys diverge somewhere inside the radix tree (at the `\0` vs
//! `'d'` byte in this example). The terminator is virtual during
//! descent and is materialised only when a new leaf key is written.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model
//!
//! Tree owns an `Arc<BufferManager>`. The BM keeps each cached
//! blob behind a `HybridLatch` (LeanStore-style 3-mode latch)
//! wrapping an `UnsafeCell<AlignedBlobBuf>`:
//!
//! - **Reads** (`get`) take the shared maintenance gate, then walk
//!   every blob in **optimistic** mode. The walker snapshots the
//!   latch version, reads the buffer, then validates; on a torn
//!   read it restarts from the root. Readers never block writers
//!   and writers never block readers; only structural maintenance
//!   (`compact` / merge) takes short exclusive maintenance windows
//!   only while folding cross-blob edges.
//! - **Writes** (`put` / `delete`) take **exclusive** mode on
//!   each blob they touch. Persistent trees additionally enter a
//!   short commit-publish critical section so checkpoint snapshots
//!   never clone bytes that lack an admitted WAL record. Durable
//!   fsync waiting happens after that section through the journal
//!   group-commit worker.
//! - **Structural maintenance** (`compact` and background merge)
//!   takes a narrow tree-wide maintenance gate only around
//!   merge/delete of cross-blob edges. Blob-local compaction runs
//!   under per-blob latches on the shared side. Normal reads and
//!   writers take the shared side while they may cross `BlobNode`
//!   boundaries; blob-local access still relies on per-blob
//!   optimistic validation.
//! - **`rename`** is multi-step (lookup probe + erase + insert)
//!   and must be atomic across all three. It takes the
//!   `rename_lock` (a `Mutex<()>` scoped to rename only) to
//!   prevent racing renames from interleaving.

///   exclusively for the blobs they touch. Persistent trees enter
///   the writer-shared `commit_gate` while publishing dirty state
///   and the journal record; durable fsync waiting happens after
///   that gate through the group-commit worker.
/// - **Maintenance** (`compact`, background merge) takes short
///   exclusive windows on `maintenance_gate` while folding/deleting
///   cross-blob edges. Blob-local compaction runs on the shared
///   side under per-blob latches. Foreground reads and writers
///   enter the shared side around tree traversal, so ordinary
///   operations stay mutually concurrent.
/// - **`rename`** holds `rename_lock` (a `Mutex<()>` scoped to
///   rename only) so its multi-step
///   `lookup → erase → insert` appears atomic to other writers.

    ///   and `txn` calls but **not** against concurrent
    ///   `put` / `delete` — those still see per-blob exclusive
    ///   latching only. Treat the batch as "all-or-nothing under
    ///   crash recovery", not "fully serializable under load".
    /// - **Mid-batch failure**: if op `N` returns an `Err`
    ///   (e.g., rename `NotFound`), ops `0..N` are already
    ///   applied to the BM and the WAL record is NOT written —
    ///   so on the next open the partial work is lost via replay.

    ///   the BM cache. Best practice: keep batches to ops you
    ///   know will succeed, or follow a failed `txn` with
    ///   `Tree::checkpoint` only after recovering desired state.
