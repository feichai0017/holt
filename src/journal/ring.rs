//! Lock-free shared WAL ring (see `docs/design/wal-ring.md`).
//!
//! The append substrate for [`super::group_commit::Journal`]. Replaced the
//! per-record `Vec` + single crossbeam channel + single batching worker (the
//! measured concurrent-write bottleneck: durable writes capped at ~0.29
//! Mops/s @16t while the in-memory ART path scaled to 5.78). N writers append
//! to ONE ordered log concurrently:
//!
//! 1. `reserve(total_len)` — one `fetch_add` on `tail`, the byte cursor.
//!    Successive reservations tile `[0, tail)` with NO gaps (each start ==
//!    the previous end), so the byte address IS the dense, gap-free order
//!    key — there is no second counter to disagree with it.
//! 2. `fill(ticket, bytes)` — parallel, non-atomic memcpy of the
//!    already-encoded record into the writer's disjoint byte range.
//! 3. `publish(ticket)` — under a brief `advance` lock, record the
//!    published byte interval and greedily fold the contiguous published
//!    prefix into `committed_addr`.
//! 4. A single flusher copies `[flush_cursor, committed_addr)` — a true
//!    contiguous, fully-written, in-order prefix — into the (unchanged)
//!    WAL writer.
//!
//! ## Why byte-keyed, not work-id-keyed
//!
//! An earlier design kept a separate dense `work_alloc` counter as the
//! order key. The loom model below caught the flaw (the design doc flagged
//! it as an open question): `work_alloc` and `tail` are independent
//! `fetch_add`s whose orders can DISAGREE — writer A can get work-id 1 but
//! byte range `[4,8)` while writer B gets work-id 2 but `[0,4)`. Folding by
//! work-id then advances `committed_addr` over a byte range whose lower
//! bytes are not yet published → the flusher copies an unpublished gap
//! (silent corruption; CRC would NOT catch it — each record is
//! individually valid). Keying on the byte tiling uses the one natural
//! order and is immune.
//!
//! ## Why the `advance` lock is load-bearing (not just mutual exclusion)
//!
//! It chains every writer's memcpy into the watermark publication. A writer
//! does its plain-store memcpy, THEN locks `advance` to record its
//! interval. Whichever writer later folds the interval starting at
//! `committed_addr` does so only after acquiring `advance` — which
//! synchronizes-with the unlock of the writer that filled it, so that
//! writer's memcpy *happens-before* the `committed_addr` Release store. The
//! flusher's single Acquire load of `committed_addr` therefore observes
//! every byte in `[0, committed_addr)`. No torn / gap copy is possible.
//!
//! ## W2D + no-stall (preserved from the work-id design)
//!
//! - W2D: checkpoint captures `committed_addr` (via the Journal's record-count
//!   watermark) under `commit_gate`'s exclusive side, which waits for in-gate
//!   writers; `publish` folds the writer's interval synchronously before it
//!   releases the gate, so the captured watermark covers every record whose
//!   blob is in the dirty snapshot.
//! - No prefix stall on `next_seq` gaps: the byte range is allocated in
//!   `reserve`, at the point a record actually exists — failed guards /
//!   early returns burn `next_seq`, never `tail`.
//!
//! The ring is a pure append substrate: `copy_committed_prefix` drains into a
//! caller-supplied sink. `group_commit` owns the `WalWriter`, the sync-ack
//! path, backpressure parking, and checkpoint integration.

// `group_commit::Journal` is the production consumer; a few small accessors
// (`append`, `tail`, …) exist only for the ring's own unit/loom tests.
#![allow(dead_code)]
// `loom` is a build-time cfg set only by the model-check pass
// (`RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom"`), never a Cargo feature, so the lint can't see it.
