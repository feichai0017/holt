//! `WalWriter` — append-only WAL file writer.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. [`WalWriter::create`] for a fresh file or
//!    [`WalWriter::open_existing`] to resume an existing one.
//! 2. Encoded records are appended into an in-memory buffer.
//!    When the buffer crosses [`AUTO_FLUSH_THRESHOLD`] (64 KB),
//!    the writer transparently drains it to the OS via `write_all`
//!    (no `sync_data`). The higher-level group-commit worker
//!    controls which append waiters share a durability flush.
//! 3. [`WalWriter::flush`] drains whatever is still pending and
//!    runs `sync_data` so every record so far is durable past a
//!    power failure. This is the **durability boundary**.
//! 4. Drop is a no-op — callers are responsible for the final
//!    `flush` (the WAL semantic is "what's flushed is durable;
//!    what's been auto-drained to page cache survives a process
//!    crash but not a power loss until you `flush`").
//!
//! The group-commit worker calls [`WalWriter::truncate`] when
//! `Tree::checkpoint` proves every WAL record is reflected in the
//! durable blob image.
