//! `WalWriter` — append-only WAL file writer.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. [`WalWriter::create`] for a fresh file or
//!    [`WalWriter::open_existing`] to resume an existing one.
//! 2. [`WalWriter::append`] for each `TxnOp` — bytes land in an
//!    in-memory buffer. When the buffer crosses
//!    [`AUTO_FLUSH_THRESHOLD`] (64 KB), `append` transparently
//!    drains it to the OS via `write_all` (no `sync_data`). This
//!    is group-commit: the WAL bytes reach the OS page cache in
//!    big batches without the user-space buffer growing
//!    unboundedly, but the per-record cost is still just an
//!    in-memory copy.
//! 3. [`WalWriter::flush`] drains whatever is still pending and
//!    runs `sync_data` so every record so far is durable past a
//!    power failure. This is the **durability boundary**.
//! 4. Drop is a no-op — callers are responsible for the final
//!    `flush` (the WAL semantic is "what's flushed is durable;
//!    what's been auto-drained to page cache survives a process
//!    crash but not a power loss until you `flush`").
//!
//! `Tree::checkpoint` calls [`WalWriter::truncate`] to trim
//! records past the last durable blob commit.
